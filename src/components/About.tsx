            Hello! I am Mat√≠as Benedetti, a student of the University Technician
            in Programming at the National Technological University.
            Additionally, I have completed 50% of the courses in the Electrical
            Engineering program at the National University of Mar del Plata,
            which provides me with additional understanding of technology and
            applied logic. I have completed the Full Stack Web Developer course
            at Digital House, where I gained solid knowledge in web development.
            I am also interested in the field of testing, having worked with
            tools such as JUnit and Jest to ensure software quality. I am
            continuously learning and passionate about solving problems through
            programming, focusing on developing practical and efficient
            solutions.
